- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Quino97
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in advanced manufacturing, engineering, integration of the physical and digital, coding as a problem solving skill, and I love Arsenal
- ðŸŒ± I hold an MSc(Eng) in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Cape Town. Currently I am most comfortable with Java and Python and I really like MATLAB. I have a base knowledge of relational databases and SQL as well as HTML and CSS. When I'm a bit more comfortable with these, I'll be moving on to JS.
